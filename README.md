# ETL-Method-For-Handling-Large-Database
ETL ( Extract Transform Load) is a method to efficiently handle large amounts of Data. This Repository consists of the various codes and files created/used in the process of exploring this technique

AIM:

To reduce the overall time taken for the execution of a large number of records in a given database.

STEPS FOLLOWED

1. Creating the basic structure of a table
2. Importing the Dummy Data from a .csv file ( As this project is for demonstration purposes only, a single row of data has been copied the required number of times)
3. The tranformation rules are set.
4. The time taken by SQL is measured
5. The file is read in a C++ or a Python Program
6. The same Transformations are performed using file Handling Operations
7. The Execution time is compared.

Scope for further Improvement - Using Multithreading
